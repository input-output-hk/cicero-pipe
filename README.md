# cicero-pipe â€” Stream facts to Cicero
Creates Cicero facts from whitespace-separated JSON on stdin
  
To include an artifact, send a `!` before the JSON and send `NN:Bs` afterward,
where `NN` matches attoparsec's `decimal @Int` parser, and `Bs` is `NN` raw bytes.

The resulting fact UUIDs will be emitted on `stdout`

```
